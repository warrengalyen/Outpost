## Outpost

> **Warning**
> This app is a work in progress and shouldn't be considered production ready. It uses new technologies that are yet to be stable such as the Server Actions and Drizzle ORM.

## About

Online marketplace built using Next.js App Router, which allows users to purchase products, sign up and list their own products for sale. Users can create a seller profile, manage products and collect payment.

Key features:

- Next.js App Router with React Server Components
- Intercepted routes (with parallel routing) for product quick view and new product creation in admin
- Server Actions for mutations
- Planetscale MySQL database with Drizzle ORM
- UploadThing for typesafe file uploads (e.g., product images)
- User authentication with Clerk
- Stripe Connect integration for marketplace payments (including platform fees and seller payouts)

## Demo

To demo the checkout experience, checkout with a test card number such as `4242 4242 4242 4242` and use any future date for the expiration and any 3 digits for the CVC. You will only be able to checkout with products from sellers that have a Stripe account connected to their store (such as [Toy Box](https://outpost.mechanikadesign.com/products?seller=toy-box)). You can also create your own seller account and connect it to Stripe for the full experience.
