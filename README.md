## Outpost

> **Warning**
> This app is a work in progress and shouldn't be considered production ready. It uses new technologies that are yet to be stable such as the Server Actions and Drizzle ORM.

## About

Online marketplace built using Next.js App Router, which allows users to purchase products, sign up and list their own products for sale. Users can create a seller profile, manage products and collect payment.

Key features:

- Next.js App Router with React Server Components
- Intercepted routes (with parallel routing) for product quick view and new product creation in admin
- Server Actions for mutations
- Planetscale MySQL database with Drizzle ORM
- UploadThing for typesafe file uploads (e.g., product images)
- User authentication with Clerk
- Stripe Connect integration for marketplace payments (including platform fees and seller payouts)

## Demo

To demo the checkout experience, checkout with a test card number such as `4242 4242 4242 4242` and use any future date for the expiration and any 3 digits for the CVC. You will only be able to checkout with products from sellers that have a Stripe account connected to their store (such as [Toy Box](https://outpost.mechanikadesign.com/products?seller=toy-box)). You can also create your own seller account and connect it to Stripe for the full experience.


## Running the app

Follow the below steps to run the app locally:

1. Create a database in Planetscale
2. Create a local .env file with the following variables as per the .env.example
3. Run `npm install`
4. Generate a migration with `npx drizzle-kit generate:mysql`
5. Push to the migration to PlanetScale with `npx drizzle-kit up:mysql`. If this fails (or nothing happens), you can alternatively run the SQL queries that were generated in the `migrations-folder` from the previous step manually in the PlanetScale console.
6. Run `npm run dev` to open the app in development mode

That's it. You should now be able to access the app at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Notes

- When generating the migration for the first time with Drizzle, ensure that the `migrations-folder` is empty or doesn't exist.

### Storybook

Storybook has been added to this app, however, hasn't been actively worked on since the initial creation of the app. Regardless, it can be ran using the following commands:

1. Run the tailwind build script to create an output file for tailwind classes

   `npm run tailwind`

2. Run Storybook

   `npm run storybook`
